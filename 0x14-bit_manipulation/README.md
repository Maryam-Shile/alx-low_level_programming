0x14. C - Bit manipulation
Date: 8/3/2023
About
Bit manipulation is simply the use of bitwise operators And (&), Or (|), Not (~), right shift (>>), left shift (<<) and exclusive Or also know as XOR (^) to manipulate bits on 0 and 1 level. 
This technique is important for performing tasks based on the state of the program. examples of its application are video compression and file encryption.
The programs in this directory and tasks performed with bitwise operation.
